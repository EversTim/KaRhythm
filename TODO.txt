* TECHNICAL: JS DOM-based tests
** Auto download? JS CSRF issues
** Curl/bash? PowerShell has curl equivalent!
*** Set up /tests/1 ... /tests/n URLs with varying contents
*** Automatically Download, paste <body /> contents in separate Jasmine SpecRunners, run tests.
**** PowerShell!
*** Concatenate test results and show
*** Set div with test things to hidden
*** Duplicate JS?
2 days
* Learning PowerShell

* Playback (JS)
4 hours
* Seems straightforward: just loop and pause

* Keyboard controls (JS)
** Highlighting current beat
** Without variable tempo so just use 120
** Timing:
*** What is the window?
*** What is the accuracy?
2 days
* Possible timing issues

* Changing length/tracks (Scala)
** Should pattern length be a minimum or an actual length?
** Immutable patterns?
2 day
* Will involve form posting (send new data, retrieve modified data)

* Saving (Scala/DB (SQL?))
** JDBC plugin included in Play, H2 for tests?
** Slick?
3 days
* Completely new things: figure out which DBMS, which connector, how to DI

* Users (Scala/DB)
3 days
* Figure out how to:
** Accept passwords
** Securely transmit them (https, authorization headers)
** Properly store them (salt + hash)
** Authenticate with them

* Tempo (JS)
** Mix-in trait?
1 day
* Will require thoughts on best implementation

* Looks (Scala (HTML)/CSS)
Should probably be done together with implementing new functions

* Track annotations e.g. instruments (Scala)
** Split patterns into tracks?
** Track is-a pattern?
*** Pattern(Seq[Track]), Track(Seq[Boolean]) extends Pattern?
1 day

* Pattern annotations (Scala)
** Adding string to pattern
1 day

* Sharing
??? days
* No idea.

* Changing parameters (length/tracks) without reload (JS?)
** JS dynamic generation of checkboxes?
** AJAX?
??? days
* No idea.
